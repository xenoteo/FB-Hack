# Problem H1: ZigZag - Easy
*10 points*

## Problem
**ZigZag** is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, similar to Sudoku. 
The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each zig, zag and square contain all the digits
from 0 to 8, inclusive, exactly once.

Zigs are diagonals, running from top left to bottom-right and wrapping around. Zags are 
diagonals, running from top-right to bottom-left (orthogonal to the zigs) and squares are 
3x3 sub-grids, similar to Sudoku.

The following diagrams indicate which Zigs, Zags and Squares each cell in a ZigZag belongs 
to.  In the Zigs diagram (left), all the cells in a Zig share a color and are connected
by lines to a cell with the Zig's numeric label. The Zags and Squares diagrams are organised
similarly:

Note that Zigs and Zags wrap around the grid, so each label appears twice in these diagrams.
Given a list of unfinished ZigZags, provide the sum of all numbers in the top three rows of
every grid, after the puzzles have been solved.

## Input
The input file format is as follows:
- The first line contains a single integer *N*, indicating the number of grids to follow.
- Each grid is printed with each of its rows on its own line.
- The "." character indicates an empty cell.
- Grids are separated from each other with an empty line.

## Output
Your output should be a file containing a single line with a number that's the sum of all
numbers in the top three rows of every grid, after the puzzles have been solved.

## Constraints
1 ≤ *N* ≤ 100
